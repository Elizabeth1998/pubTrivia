# pubTrivia

##Let's Play some trivia!!

My friends and I love to play pub trivia; however, with everything going on we have not been able to go out and play. Therefore, I have been working on this verison
of Pub Trivia with React, TypeScript, and the Open Trivia Database API. The following instructions allow for you to have a copy of the game to run locally on your machine. I want to work on hosting this but for now I will save the code I have here. Good luck and have fun!! :) 


##Installation

Ensure that you have React installed
Clone this repo
Npm install

##Starting the application 

Start the application with 
  '''bash
    npm start
    '''

##Have Fun!!
